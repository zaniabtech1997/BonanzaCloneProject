# BonanzaCloneProject
I worked on the front-end development of an online store project that is a clone of the Bonanza app. My responsibilities include creating a user-friendly interface, implementing responsive design principles, and ensuring seamless navigation. Using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
